# Karpathy Code Workflow — Agentic Coding Principles

A Code-First Guide to AI-Agent Workflow. This skill operationalizes the six **Coding Workflow Principles** and four **Core Principles** that
define high-quality agentic software engineering. Apply them in every coding interaction.

> **Tradeoff:** these guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial, one-line tasks, use judgment — don't apply the full ritual where it adds no value.

## SELECCIÓN DE MODO (este proyecto)

El usuario **no programa**: pide el cambio en lenguaje natural, como en base44
("pon el logo más pequeño", "cambia el texto de contacto", "que la web cargue más rápido").
Nunca le pidas que elija el modo ni le hables de ramas, commits o rutas de archivo salvo
que él lo saque. **Tú** clasificas la petición y anuncias el modo en una línea antes de tocar
nada: *"Voy en modo Directo: cambio el color del botón del header."*

| Modo | Cuándo | Qué haces |
|---|---|---|
| **Directo** | Cambio local y evidente: un texto, un color, un tamaño, una imagen, un enlace. Sin ambigüedad, sin efectos en otras páginas. | Aplica los 4 Core Principles y edita. Sin plan escrito. Verifica el diff y el render. |
| **Guiado** | Varios archivos o varias páginas, o hay una decisión visible (dónde va, cómo se comporta), o toca `server.js` / Docker / despliegue. | Plan inline de 2–4 puntos en lenguaje llano, **gate de suposiciones load-bearing** con `AskUserQuestion` (opciones descritas por su efecto visible, no por su implementación), luego implementa y verifica. |
| **Spec** | Rediseño, sección nueva completa, cambio que afecta a todo el sitio, o algo cuyo alcance no se conoce sin explorar. | Plan estructurado (Contexto, Enfoque, Riesgo, Pasos), subagentes en paralelo para explorar, confirmación del usuario antes de escribir código, implementación por pasos verificados. |

**Reglas de este proyecto que condicionan cualquier modo:**
- `public/` es salida del crawler `website-crawler`. Editarlo a mano es aceptable **solo** cuando la
  petición es un cambio de contenido del sitio; avisa al usuario en una frase de que ese cambio
  se sobrescribiría si el sitio se vuelve a crawlear.
- Todo el trabajo va directo a `main`, lineal. Sin ramas de feature, sin PRs.
- Al terminar, resume en lenguaje llano **qué ve el usuario ahora que antes no veía** (por lo que
  se ve en la web, no por archivos), di en qué página mirarlo y recuérdale que puede decir
  "Visualizar cambios en local" para verlo en el navegador, y después "Confirmar los Cambios" o
  "Revertir Cambios" (ver `CLAUDE.md`).

## CORE PRINCIPLES (Non-Negotiable)

These four principles override everything else. Violating them produces low-quality work regardless
of how sophisticated the workflow appears.

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Think Before Coding** | State assumptions explicitly. Don't hide confusion — ask. Present multiple interpretations instead of silently picking one. Push back when the request is wrong, ambiguous, or has a better alternative. |
| **Simplicity First** | Write minimal code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative. No future-proofing that wasn't asked for. |
| **No Laziness** | Find root causes. Never apply temporary fixes or patches. Hold to senior developer standards — understand before acting. |
| **Minimal Impact** | Only touch what is necessary. No side effects. No new bugs introduced. Leave unrelated code untouched. |

### Think Before Coding — always active

Unlike the workflow steps below, this disposition applies to **every** task, including trivial ones that skip plan mode. The most common LLM failure is making a wrong assumption on the user's behalf and running with it. Before and during work:

- **State assumptions explicitly** — classify them by blast radius and gate the load-bearing ones (see Mechanics).
- **Don't hide confusion** — if something is unclear or inconsistent, name it and ask rather than guessing.
- **Present multiple interpretations** — when a request is ambiguous, surface the options as a choice instead of silently picking one.
- **Push back** — when there's a simpler path, a contradiction, or the request looks wrong, say so via the incoherence template. Don't be sycophantic.

**Mechanics:**
- **Assumption gate** — classify each assumption by blast radius. *Load-bearing* (wrong → large rework, wrong architecture, or data loss): present it as an explicit choice with the tradeoff per option via `AskUserQuestion`, and do not write code until the user decides. *Cosmetic* (wrong → trivial later fix): list it and proceed; the user may interrupt. *Trivial task*: skip the gate.
- **Incoherence template** — "You said X, but the codebase already does Y via Z — extend, replace, or build parallel?"
- **Recon first** — ground assumptions in the code (read the likely integration points) before fixing the plan; don't invent them.

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Stonewalling or looping after the user has confirmed — disagree once with an argument, then log it as a known decision and proceed.
- Gating every assumption — that breeds fatigue and rubber-stamping; gate only the load-bearing ones.

**Decision gate — before writing any code, ask:**
- Have I surfaced my assumptions, or am I guessing on the user's behalf?
- Does this solve the problem with the least code?
- Am I addressing the root cause, not a symptom?
- Will I introduce any side effects or touch anything unrelated?

If any answer is "no" or "uncertain" — stop and reconsider.

## CODING WORKFLOW PRINCIPLES

Apply these six principles in sequence for any non-trivial coding task.

---

### 1. Plan Mode First

**When:** Any task that isn't trivially one-line or purely additive.

**How:**
1. Before writing code, produce a concise written plan:
   - What is the problem / success criterion?
   - What will change and what won't?
   - What are the edge cases and tradeoffs?
   - What is the minimal surface area of the solution?
2. For smaller tasks: an inline lightweight plan (2–4 bullet points).
3. For larger tasks: a structured spec with sections (Context, Approach, Risk, Steps).
4. **Do not write code until the plan is clear.** Reduce ambiguity first.

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Jumping straight to implementation.
- Asking "what should I do?" without first reasoning through the plan yourself.
- Writing speculative code "in case it's needed."

---

### 2. Verify Relentlessly

**When:** During and after every implementation step.

**How:**
1. Monitor execution like a hawk — don't blindly accept output.
2. Check assumptions before acting on them.
3. Enumerate edge cases and tradeoffs explicitly.
4. Run tests, review diffs, verify correctness at each step — not just at the end.
5. Stay in the loop: read the output, read the diff, think before continuing.

**Verification checklist per step:**
- [ ] Did the change do exactly what I intended?
- [ ] Did it break anything else?
- [ ] Does the diff look clean and minimal?
- [ ] Are there edge cases I haven't tested?

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Accepting the first output without inspection.
- Skipping diff review.
- Assuming tests pass without running them.

---

### 3. Keep It Simple

**When:** At every design and implementation decision point.

**How:**
1. Before choosing an approach, ask: *"Is there a simpler way?"*
2. Prefer 100 lines over 1000. Less code = less surface area = fewer bugs. If ~200 lines could be ~50, rewrite it.
3. Avoid bloated abstractions, unnecessary layers, premature generalization. No unrequested flexibility or configurability.
4. No error handling for scenarios that cannot occur — don't guard against the impossible.
5. Remove only the imports, variables, and functions that **your own change** orphaned. Preserve pre-existing dead code — flag it separately, never delete it silently unless the user explicitly asks.
6. If an abstraction isn't pulled by an immediate need, don't add it.

**Simplicity heuristics:**
- Would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated?
- Could a junior developer understand this in 5 minutes?
- Is every layer of indirection earning its keep?
- Does removing this abstraction break anything?

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Introducing design patterns "for extensibility."
- Adding helper utilities that are only used once.
- Writing defensive code for scenarios that don't exist yet.

---

### 4. Surgical Edits Only

**When:** Any modification to existing code.

**How:**
1. Change **only** what is necessary to fulfill the task.
2. Do not touch unrelated code, comments, or formatting — even if they look "wrong."
3. Do not "improve" things that aren't broken (unless explicitly asked).
4. Minimize diff size and churn. The smaller the diff, the easier to review and the lower the risk.
5. If you spot something unrelated that needs fixing, flag it separately — don't fix it inline.

**Surgical edit rules:**
- One logical change per commit / per response.
- If you must refactor to make the change safe, separate the refactor from the feature.
- Preserve existing style and conventions unless explicitly asked to change them.
- Clean up only what your change orphaned. Pre-existing dead code stays — flag it, don't remove it.

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Reformatting entire files when only one function changed.
- "Fixing" variable names or comments that weren't in scope.
- Bundling multiple unrelated changes in one edit.
- Deleting pre-existing dead code or cruft that your task didn't create.

---

### 5. Goal-Driven Execution

**When:** Any agentic or multi-step coding task.

**How:**
1. Define the success criterion **before** starting. What does "done" look like exactly?
2. Write tests first (or define assertions), then write the code that makes them pass.
3. Use tools in the loop — browser MCP, shell, linters, type checkers — don't just rely on reasoning.
4. Let the agent iterate until the goal is explicitly met, not until it "looks right."
5. Only stop when the success criterion is verifiably satisfied.

**Goal-framing template:**
```
Goal: [What does success look like?]
Test: [How will I verify it?]
Scope: [What is in scope / out of scope?]
Done when: [Concrete, observable condition]
```

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Stopping when "it compiles" without verifying behavior.
- Setting vague goals ("make it better").
- Iterating by feel rather than by failing tests.

---

### 6. Parallelize with Subagents

**When:** Tasks involving research, exploration, multi-file analysis, or multiple independent workstreams.

**How:**
1. Identify workstreams that are independent and can run in parallel.
2. Offload research, exploration, and analysis to subagents — keep the main context clean.
3. One task per subagent for focus — don't ask a subagent to do two things.
4. Merge results back with judgment — don't blindly accept subagent output.
5. Use subagents to preserve main context window for high-level reasoning.

**Decomposition heuristics:**
- Can this task be split into N independent sub-tasks?
- Would doing this inline pollute the main context with noise?
- Is this a research/exploration task that doesn't need to be done sequentially?

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Running long explorations inline when a subagent could do it.
- Giving a subagent compound tasks ("research X AND implement Y").
- Accepting subagent output without review.
